# IPL-Data-Analysis-with-Python
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Indian Premier League (IPL) data using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
It was created as part of my 5-Day Python for Data Science Bootcamp to practice data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and extracting insights from real-world datasets.

📂 Dataset

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle – IPL Dataset
 and includes:

matches.csv → Match-level data (season, teams, winner, toss, etc.)

deliveries.csv → Ball-by-ball data (batsman, bowler, runs, dismissals, etc.)

📊 Analysis Performed

Number of matches played per season

Most successful IPL teams (by wins)

Toss decision trends (bat vs field)

Top 10 run scorers

Top 10 wicket takers

📷 Visualizations

Here are a few charts generated in the project:
